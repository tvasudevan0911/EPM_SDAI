A navy to end the 'bitter memories' Between 2019 and 2023, China's four largest shipyards - Dalian, Guangzhou, Jiangnan and Hudong-Zhonghua - produced 39 warships with a combined displacement of 550,000 tonnes, according to a study by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS). That is the volume of water they displace, which is the most common way of measuring the size of a vessel or fleet. In comparison, the UK's Royal Navy currently has an estimated total displacement of around 399,000 tonnes. While China has the world's largest navy by number of vessels, the US fleet has a greater overall tonnage and is more powerful - with far more large aircraft carriers.But Beijing is catching up.\"There's no sign that the Chinese are slowing down,\" says Alexander Palmer from the CSIS and author of the report, Unpacking China's Naval Buildup.\"Hull count [number of ships] is not the only measure of a navy's effectiveness of course, but the ability to produce and churn out warships has been extremely impressive and could make a strategic difference.\" Between 2019 and 2023, China's four largest shipyards - Dalian, Guangzhou, Jiangnan and Hudong-Zhonghua - produced 39 warships with a combined displacement of 550,000 tonnes, according to a study by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS).

Beijing may have more ships, but it only has two operational aircraft carriers, and its navy has far fewer submarines than the US.Some analysts argue they are also not as sophisticated as the American ones, which have a technological head start going back to the the Cold War. The Chinese subs are also largely built for the shallower South China Sea, where a game of cat-and-mouse with the US is already under way. For now, China's ability to travel far from its own coastline is limited.But there are signs this is changing, and fast.Satellite imagery obtained by BBC Verify from Hainan, a Chinese island province in the South China Sea, suggests Beijing is pouring significant funding into expanding its naval bases. The base at Yulin has five new piers which appear to have been constructed in the last five years. It is thought China plans to base all of its largest submarines, the Jin-class (or Type 094), in this port. These new subs can carry 12 nuclear missiles each.

Photographs and footage of rehearsals, shared on Chinese social media, suggest that at least two new types of unmanned underwater drones, which look like large torpedoes, will be among the new systems on show at next week's parade. These could allow China to carry out surveillance deep underwater and detect other submarines or even undersea cables without risking its own naval forces.Much of the technology is still \"unproven and the timeline of its capabilities is still unclear\", cautions Matthew Funaiole from CSIS's China Power Project. \"The big question is how long will it take for the technology to mature.\"And that's why the US cannot overlook the threat China's shipbuilding represents, he adds.The country's vast naval buildup is being propelled by a party that is still reeling from the pains of the past - and is more than willing to channel them to buttress its message of loyalty, power and patriotism. Holding a massive military parade to commemorate the victory over Japan, and the end of its brutal occupation, is testament to that.

Getty Images Getty Images Xi Jinping has been pushing hard for infrastructure that is an example of \"military-civilian fusion\" What the rest of the world sees as China's rise, Xi sees as its resurgence. He has touted the value of a \"strong navy to safeguard national security\". He cites 470 invasions between 1840 and 1949 that brought \"untold suffering\" - as the once-powerful Qing empire cracked, China plunged into turmoil, revolution and civil war. And he has vowed that his country will never again be \"humiliated\" or relive those \"bitter memories of foreign assaults\".Where China has an undeniable edge is the dual use of shipyards. Many of those that support commercial production can also help produce warships for the navy. Military and civilian shipyards work hand in hand in some places, which state media describes as \"military-civilian fusion\", a concept Xi has pushed hard.Dalian, which Beijing calls a \"flagship shipyard\", plays a big part in this.

'Hide your strength, bide your time' But the world should not worry, says Prof Hu Bo, director of the Center for Maritime Strategy Studies at Peking University.\"We have no interest in interfering in the business of other countries, especially militarily,\" he adds. His message is that China is building big ships because it can, not because it wants to take over the world.There is one island which China does not see as another country: Taiwan.Beijing has long vowed to \"reunify\" with the democratic island and has not ruled out the use of force. In recent years, high-ranking US officials have declared that China will invade Taiwan by 2027, but Beijing denies there is a deadline.\"China already has the capacity to take Taiwan back,\" Prof Hu Bo says, \"but China doesn't do that because we have patience. China has never given up on the prospect of peaceful unification.

Washington is bound by law to provide arms to help Taiwan defend itself - support which is unacceptable to Beijing for what is considers a breakaway province that will eventually be part of China.Earlier this year US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth warned that China posed an \"imminent\" threat to Taiwan, and urged Asian countries to boost defence spending and work with the US to deter war.So despite Prof Hu Bo's assurances, it is hard to ignore the fact that China's warships are beginning to sail further from the country's shores.In February, they were seen circumnavigating Australia's coastline for more than three weeks where they staged unprecedented live-fire drills. More recently Chinese aircraft carriers conducted naval drills near Japan, sparking concern - although it was in international waters, the move was unprecedented.

Pakistan's armed forces heavily used China-made equipment, including fighter jets and radar systems.A senior army officer in Delhi said Beijing also provided \"live inputs\" to Pakistan on Indian positions.

The first was to cave in and stop buying Russian oil. But it has refused to do so, largely because Russia is an \"all-weather\" ally and giving into pressure doesn't suit Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's strongman image.The second was to stand firm and seek other opportunities and India appears to have to chosen this option for now.It's also pragmatic to look no further when your neighbour is the world's second-largest economy and a global manufacturing powerhouse.It was in this context, that Modi met Chinese President Xi Jinping in Tianjin over the weekend.

Modi has invested personally in the India-China relationship since coming to power in 2014, visiting the neighbouring country five times until 2018.But the 2020 border clash put brakes on this momentum and it has taken seven long years for Modi to visit China again.The key to making further progress will depend on how the two countries deal with their border issues.Tens of thousands of troops from both countries are still deployed at their contested borders - though there are ongoing talks between their civilian and military leaders to ease the situation.

AFP via Getty Images AFP via Getty Images The US-imposed 50% tariffs on India has caused some anger Both Chinese and Indian readouts after the meeting this weekend talked about maintaining peace at the border and \"not turning their differences into disputes\".For India, there is the issue of a burgeoning trade deficit with China, amounting to more than $99bn (£73bn).Both countries still have high tariffs and duties against each other in many sectors.Beijing would want India to open its market of 1.4 billion people to Chinese products, but Delhi would be wary of doing that without addressing the deficit.The outreach to China, which started with Modi meeting Xi in Kazan last year, may have been supercharged by Trump tariffs, but ground realities for India remain unchanged. The Modi-Xi meeting is being seen as part of India's policy of \"strategic autonomy\" but it will also cause more geopolitical challenges for Delhi.India is due to host the Quad (which includes Japan, Australia and the US) summit later this year. The forum was largely seen as a challenge to China's dominance in the Indo-Pacific region.It's not clear if Trump will attend, but if he does and says something against China, it will immediately test the renewed synergy between Delhi and Beijing.Delhi is also part of several other multilateral forums that are perceived as anti-China and anti-Russia.How Delhi plays its strategic autonomy in the next few months will very much influence the direction India-China ties take.For now, it's clear that India-US ties are at an all-time low. A Trump aide recently called the Russia-Ukraine conflict \"Modi's war\".Delhi has also consistently denied that Trump played any role in the ceasefire between India and Pakistan in May – this has become a constant irritant for the US president.Despite this, India has refrained from imposing retaliatory tariffs against the US and has left the door ajar for further negotiations. After all, the US is India's biggest trading partner.Will going closer to China help India's negotiations with the US or will it have the opposite impact?This is the question that will likely dominate geopolitical discussions in Delhi and beyond in the coming months.

Delhi is also part of several other multilateral forums that are perceived as anti-China and anti-Russia. How Delhi plays its strategic autonomy in the next few months will very much influence the direction India-China ties take. For now, it's clear that India-US ties are at an all-time low. A Trump aide recently called the Russia-Ukraine conflict \"Modi's war\". Delhi has also consistently denied that Trump played any role in the ceasefire between India and Pakistan in May – this has become a constant irritant for the US president. Despite this, India has refrained from imposing retaliatory tariffs against the US and has left the door ajar for further negotiations. After all, the US is India's biggest trading partner. Will going closer to China help India's negotiations with the US or will it have the opposite impact? This is the question that will likely dominate geopolitical discussions in Delhi and beyond in the coming months.

This represents quite a hit on the country's economy so New Delhi would be looking around for other business partners.Look no further than right here, Xi may well say, as his administration attempts to rebuild from the wreckage of China-India relations following years of tension between the two.And, if their official readouts are anything to go by, Modi's attendance at the Tianjin Summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation seems to have paid off.His published comments to Xi were much more specific than the those coming the other way.There is now a very good window for Beijing and New Delhi to repair their strained relationship.China's leader knows that Donald Trump's tariff onslaught is pushing India away from the United States and that this great economic rival needs other partnerships.Considerable obstacles remain.They include China's backing of India's key rival Pakistan; interaction of all types has been in the doldrums; angry rhetoric from both governments (over many years) has created a climate of suspicion between the Asian heavyweights and their high-mountain border dispute has stirred nationalist sentiment on both sides of the frontier.

Under the new laws, platforms must take \"reasonable steps\" to prevent Australian children from creating accounts on their sites, and deactivate existing ones. Though the move is popular with many parents, experts have raised concerns over data privacy and the accuracy of age verification technology. The federal government commissioned the UK-based Age Check Certification Scheme to test the ways Australia could enforce the ban, and its final report was published on Sunday.It looked at a variety of methods - including formal verification using government documents, parental approval, or technologies to determine age based on facial structure, gestures, or behaviours - and found all were technically possible.\"But we did not find a single ubiquitous solution that would suit all use cases, nor did we find solutions that were guaranteed to be effective in all deployments,\" it said.Verification using identity documents was cited as the most accurate method, but the report identified concerns that platforms may keep this data longer than required and was anticipating sharing it with regulators, both of which would leave users' privacy at risk.Australia - like much of the world - has in recent years seen a series of high-profile data breaches, including several where sensitive personal information was stolen and sold or published.Facial assessment technology was 92% accurate for people aged 18 or over, but there is a \"buffer zone\" - about two to three years either side of 16 - in which is it is less accurate. The report said this would lead to false positives, clearing children for accounts, and false negatives, barring users who should be allowed.There are also privacy and accuracy concerns with parental approval methods, it said.It recommended that the methods should be \"layered\" to create the most robust system, and highlighted that many of the technology providers were looking at ways to address circumvention, through things like document forgeries and VPNs (virtual private networks) which obscure the user's country.Communications Minister Anika Wells said there was \"no one-size-fits-all solution\", that the report showed age checks could be \"private, efficient and effective\". \"These are some of the world's richest companies. They are at the forefront of AI. They use the data that we give them for a bevy of commercial purposes. I think it is reasonable to ask them to use that same data and tech to keep kids safe online,\" she told reporters on Monday.\"There is no excuse for social media platforms not to have a combination of age assurance methods in their platforms ready for 10 December.\"Under the ban, tech companies can fined up to A$50m ($32.5m; £25.7m) if they do not take \"reasonable steps\" to bar those aged under 16 from holding accounts.

A navy to end the 'bitter memories' Between 2019 and 2023, China's four largest shipyards - Dalian, Guangzhou, Jiangnan and Hudong-Zhonghua - produced 39 warships with a combined displacement of 550,000 tonnes, according to a study by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS). That is the volume of water they displace, which is the most common way of measuring the size of a vessel or fleet. In comparison, the UK's Royal Navy currently has an estimated total displacement of around 399,000 tonnes. While China has the world's largest navy by number of vessels, the US fleet has a greater overall tonnage and is more powerful - with far more large aircraft carriers.But Beijing is catching up.\"There's no sign that the Chinese are slowing down,\" says Alexander Palmer from the CSIS and author of the report, Unpacking China's Naval Buildup.\"Hull count [number of ships] is not the only measure of a navy's effectiveness of course, but the ability to produce and churn out warships has been extremely impressive and could make a strategic difference.\" Between 2019 and 2023, China's four largest shipyards - Dalian, Guangzhou, Jiangnan and Hudong-Zhonghua - produced 39 warships with a combined displacement of 550,000 tonnes, according to a study by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS).

Beijing may have more ships, but it only has two operational aircraft carriers, and its navy has far fewer submarines than the US.Some analysts argue they are also not as sophisticated as the American ones, which have a technological head start going back to the the Cold War. The Chinese subs are also largely built for the shallower South China Sea, where a game of cat-and-mouse with the US is already under way. For now, China's ability to travel far from its own coastline is limited.But there are signs this is changing, and fast.Satellite imagery obtained by BBC Verify from Hainan, a Chinese island province in the South China Sea, suggests Beijing is pouring significant funding into expanding its naval bases. The base at Yulin has five new piers which appear to have been constructed in the last five years. It is thought China plans to base all of its largest submarines, the Jin-class (or Type 094), in this port. These new subs can carry 12 nuclear missiles each. There are still limits on China's naval rise. Beijing may have more ships, but it only has two operational aircraft carriers, and its navy has far fewer submarines than the US. Some analysts argue they are also not as sophisticated as the American ones, which have a technological head start going back to the the Cold War.

Photographs and footage of rehearsals, shared on Chinese social media, suggest that at least two new types of unmanned underwater drones, which look like large torpedoes, will be among the new systems on show at next week's parade. These could allow China to carry out surveillance deep underwater and detect other submarines or even undersea cables without risking its own naval forces.Much of the technology is still \"unproven and the timeline of its capabilities is still unclear\", cautions Matthew Funaiole from CSIS's China Power Project. \"The big question is how long will it take for the technology to mature.\"And that's why the US cannot overlook the threat China's shipbuilding represents, he adds.The country's vast naval buildup is being propelled by a party that is still reeling from the pains of the past - and is more than willing to channel them to buttress its message of loyalty, power and patriotism. Holding a massive military parade to commemorate the victory over Japan, and the end of its brutal occupation, is testament to that.

Getty Images Getty Images Xi Jinping has been pushing hard for infrastructure that is an example of \"military-civilian fusion\" What the rest of the world sees as China's rise, Xi sees as its resurgence. He has touted the value of a \"strong navy to safeguard national security\". He cites 470 invasions between 1840 and 1949 that brought \"untold suffering\" - as the once-powerful Qing empire cracked, China plunged into turmoil, revolution and civil war. And he has vowed that his country will never again be \"humiliated\" or relive those \"bitter memories of foreign assaults\".Where China has an undeniable edge is the dual use of shipyards. Many of those that support commercial production can also help produce warships for the navy.

'Hide your strength, bide your time' But the world should not worry, says Prof Hu Bo, director of the Center for Maritime Strategy Studies at Peking University.\"We have no interest in interfering in the business of other countries, especially militarily,\" he adds. His message is that China is building big ships because it can, not because it wants to take over the world.There is one island which China does not see as another country: Taiwan.Beijing has long vowed to \"reunify\" with the democratic island and has not ruled out the use of force. In recent years, high-ranking US officials have declared that China will invade Taiwan by 2027, but Beijing denies there is a deadline.\"China already has the capacity to take Taiwan back,\" Prof Hu Bo says, \"but China doesn't do that because we have patience.

Washington is bound by law to provide arms to help Taiwan defend itself - support which is unacceptable to Beijing for what is considers a breakaway province that will eventually be part of China.Earlier this year US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth warned that China posed an \"imminent\" threat to Taiwan, and urged Asian countries to boost defence spending and work with the US to deter war.So despite Prof Hu Bo's assurances, it is hard to ignore the fact that China's warships are beginning to sail further from the country's shores.In February, they were seen circumnavigating Australia's coastline for more than three weeks where they staged unprecedented live-fire drills. More recently Chinese aircraft carriers conducted naval drills near Japan, sparking concern - although it was in international waters, the move was unprecedented.

If the Russian leader does not agree, \"it will show again President Putin has played President Trump\", said Macron.But in an interview with CNN, on 22 August, Trump himself again gave Putin \"a couple of weeks\" to give a response before the US takes action, in the latest of a series of ultimatums and deadlines he has issued to the Russian leader.

Bill Drexel, a fellow at the Center for Strategy and American Statecraft at the Hudson Institute, says that because decision-making is largely driven by Trump, having an India envoy who's close to him could be a major asset to India-US ties. \"But there may be a steep learning curve given his [Gor's] limited diplomatic and regional experience,\" Mr Drexel says. Ms Ayres echoes a similar view. She says that Gor's closeness with the president could help \"break through\" potential policy logjams. Mr Haas, however, says that Gor's lack of diplomatic experience could pose a problem in an already strained relationship and that the US should have picked an envoy who could help improve the situation. \"Instead, I suspect that Delhi will interpret this appointment as a slap in the face and further evidence that Trump doesn't care about the relationship,\" he says.

This represents quite a hit on the country's economy so New Delhi would be looking around for other business partners.Look no further than right here, Xi may well say, as his administration attempts to rebuild from the wreckage of China-India relations following years of tension between the two.And, if their official readouts are anything to go by, Modi's attendance at the Tianjin Summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation seems to have paid off.His published comments to Xi were much more specific than the those coming the other way.There is now a very good window for Beijing and New Delhi to repair their strained relationship.China's leader knows that Donald Trump's tariff onslaught is pushing India away from the United States and that this great economic rival needs other partnerships.Considerable obstacles remain.They include China's backing of India's key rival Pakistan; interaction of all types has been in the doldrums; angry rhetoric from both governments (over many years) has created a climate of suspicion between the Asian heavyweights and their high-mountain border dispute has stirred nationalist sentiment on both sides of the frontier.
